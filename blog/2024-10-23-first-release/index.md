# Metive 0.1.0 First Release

Hello world! This is the first release of Metive. We are excited to announce that we have finally released the first version of Metive. We have been working on this project for a long time and we are happy to finally share it with the world.

## What is Metive?

First of all, the word itself doesn't mean anything - it's just easy to pronounce.

Metive is a tool that allows you to create motion capture animations using AI. It is a simple and easy-to-use tool that allows you to create animations without the need for expensive equipment or software.

## The Story Behind Metive

Metive is a service developed by three university students. 

Initially, a team was created and various plans were discussed, and finally, we decided to develop an AI motion capture service compatible with MMD.

The initial plan was to include AI mocap and implement a number of MMD features on top of it. However, after considering the deliverables that could be made within the timeframe, we decided to release the tool as a tool with AI mocap only.

## Our Plans for the Future

We're doing this open beta to set the course for the future, and it's up to you to tell us what kind of tool Metive will be in the future.

Thank you.
