**Metive allows you to export the motion of a person in a video as a VMD animation.**

To do this, we need the following data:

- A video of the person
- A PMX model for retarget and render the animation

In this article, we will discuss how to export the motion of a person in a video as a VMD animation using Metive.

**The overall process is as follows:**

1. Upload the video with one person to Metive
2. Run AI Motion Capture to extract the motion of the person
3. Load the PMX model to Metive
4. Retarget the motion to the PMX model
5. Export the motion as a VMD animation
